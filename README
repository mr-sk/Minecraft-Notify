Minecraft Nofity (MCNotify) README

Note:
- This requires some mail() implementation on the system.
- This runs on linux only
- This code isn't really commented or organized in a an easy manner. Its
  just a script, but I know others will find it useful.

1) Update the location of your server log
> $mcServerLog   = '~minecraft/server.log';
2) Provide all the email addresses you want to email
> $cmd = sprintf('echo "psssssss B0000M!" | mail -s "%s" your@mail.com', $subject);
3) Run it - (I like to run in screen)
